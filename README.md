# sukjunub

  - SukJunub is cross-platform ecommerce mobel application.
  - Flutter is used as the framework. The database is powerd by firebase storage
and the authentication by Firebase auth.
  - I used Firebase because of its websocket-like technology so that a client can easily access data 
as quickly as possible.
  - Any other technologies and databases can also be intergrated.

## Getting Started

  - To re-use or clone the application, you can download the zip or fork from "https://github.com/jima05/sukjunub".

      - flutter pub upgrade :  This is to upgrade the dependencies to there latest versions
